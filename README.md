# User Management App

The User Management App is a backend application built with Node.js and SQL. It provides functionalities for user registration, login, and profile management.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can register by providing their name, email, and password. The password is securely hashed before being stored in the database.
- User Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password. Authentication is handled by generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for subsequent requests.
- Profile Management: Authenticated users can access their profile information, including name and email, by making a request to the `/profile` endpoint.
